    * QDRDBMS version 0.0.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    QDRDBMS-0.0.0.tar.gz.  QDRDBMS version 0.0.0 for Perl 6 is not released
    at this time, if ever, since it is currently released only as part of
    the Perl6-Pugs project (in its ext/QDRDBMS/ subdirectory), which sets
    its own less frequent release schedule.  The rest of this Changes entry
    refers only to the Perl 5 version.

    * To be more specific, the version 0.0.0 that is released on CPAN is a
    severely stripped down copy of the version 0.0.0 that is in version
    control.  All executable code was stripped out, leaving only the POD to
    go on CPAN.  It is expected that the first release after 2007 June 29
    will not be stripped, and have all code and documentation.

    * This is the first release of the Perl 5 QDRDBMS distribution, and the
    first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 modules named
    QDRDBMS::\w+.

    * This is the initial file manifest:
